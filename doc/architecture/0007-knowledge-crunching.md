## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have to make a decision, how we describe the core use cases of the application.

## Decision

We use [Domain Storytelling](https://domainstorytelling.org/) to describe core use cases & interactions.
All user stories can be found in the [`./doc/user-stories`](./doc/user-stories) directory.

## Consequences

Optionally [Domain Story Modeler](https://github.com/WPS/domain-story-modeler) can be used as a lightweight tool.
