# 3. Application Framework

Date: 2020-03-19

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have to decide for a programming language / application framework.

## Decision

We stick to [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot), with [Java 11](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/corretto/latest/corretto-11-ug/downloads-list.html) and [Gradle](https://gradle.org/).

## Consequences

_"Spring Boot makes it easy to create stand-alone, production-grade Spring based Applications that you can 'just run'"_ [source](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot)
