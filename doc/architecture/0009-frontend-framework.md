# 9. Frontend Framework

Date: 2020-03-20

## Status

Accepted

## Context

We have to decide for a frontend application and a styling/component framework.

## Decision

We stick to [Angular](https://angular.io/) together with [NG ZORRO Ant Design](https://ng.ant.design/) and [NG Alain](https://ng-alain.com/).

## Consequences

From prototype through global deployment, Angular delivers the productivity and scalable infrastructure that supports Google's largest applications.
