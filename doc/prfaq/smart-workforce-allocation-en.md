# Smart Workforce Allocator - _Help to Help_
> Compensating disruptions in the economy & job market, due to the Corona-crisis

## Summary
Smart Workforce Allocator (SWA) is a martketplace to connect idle qualified people, who are willing to work and companies, suffering from peek demands in workforce.

## Problem
The corona-pandemic not only disrupted the global health system but also the global economy.
A variety of industry branches (e.g. hotels, travel agencies, etc) are getting bankrupt while others can't satisfy the peeking demand (e.g. grocery stores).
This leads to an extreme imbalance of a lot of idle, well qualified people, willing to work & help and on the other hand a massive number of companies, that have trouble getting employees to do the work - even forcing people to return from their vacation.
The current measures for short-time-work are **bureaucratic**, job agencies are **overloaded** and the information is **not transparent**.

## Solution
SWA helps to mitigate this imbalance and directly connects employer and employees, building on the principles **ease of use**, **flexibility** & **optized allocation**.

#### - Ease of Use -
SWA is meant as the **single source of information**. 
It is available as a web-application as well as a native app for iOS and Android - making it easily accessible for the majority of citizens.
Due to it's features like **e-signature**, **24-h live chat** or **Paypal-Integration** no third party services are required to benefit from SWA.

#### - Credibility -
SWA is built & run in collaboration with federal agencies, making it as credible as the government itself.
All users have  24hr the option to notify the administrators about suspicious behaviour or raise concers about certain incidents.
SWA tries to be as transparent as possible - a key driver in times of crisis.

#### - Flexibility  -
Both, employers and employees have the full freedom to specify their demands.
Even though the recommendation built on an optimized allocation, every user can make his own decisions based on personal preferences.

#### - Optimized Allocation -
The **secret sauce** of SWA is a **benevolent artificial intelligence** that tries to maximize the benefit for all parties (for further details of the problem domain you might want to take a look at [assignment problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) or [the adwords problem](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch8.pdf))

## Customer Quote(s)
> "Due to the Corona-crisis me & my colleagues have been put on hold, receiving only 30% of our monthly wages.

I was really astonished by the ease of use and flexibilty." - S.Bergmann (Hotel Staff)

Thanks to SWA we had been able to fill the gap, which was caused by the spiking demand within a short period of time. What I really liked about SWA, are the real-time notificaitons and smart allocation across stores". - F.Maier (Sales Manger Retail)
