## 🤯 Problem Statement
> What exact problem are we trying to solve?

The corona-pandemic not only disrupted the global health system but also the global economy.
A variety of industry branches (e.g. hotels, travel agencies, etc) are getting bankrupt while others can't satisfy the peeking demand (e.g. grocery stores).
This leads to an extreme imbalance of a lot of idle, well qualified people, willing to work & help and on the other hand a massive number of companies, that have trouble getting employees to do the work - even forcing people to return from their vacation.
The current measures for short-time-work are **bureaucratic**, job agencies are **overloaded** and the information is **not transparent**.

## 🚀 Solution
> How are we trying to solve this problem?

SWAG helps to mitigate this imbalance and directly connects employer and employees, building on the principles **ease of use**, **flexibility** & **optimized allocation**.

## 🧪 Unique Selling Point
> What is unique about our approach

#### - Credibility -
SWAG is built & run in collaboration with federal agencies, making it as credible as the government itself.
All users have  24hr the option to notify the administrators about suspicious behaviour or raise concers about certain incidents.
SWAG tries to be as transparent as possible - a key driver in times of crisis.

#### - Flexibility  -
Both, employers and employees have the full freedom to specify their demands.
Even though the recommendation built on an optimized allocation, every user can make his own decisions based on personal preferences.

#### - Optimized Allocation -
The **secret sauce** of SWA is a **benevolent artificial intelligence** that tries to maximize the benefit for all parties (for further details of the problem domain you might want to take a look at [assignment problems](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Assignment_problem) or [the adwords problem](http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/mmds/ch8.pdf))

## 🦄 User Stories
> What concrete user stories do we have in the current scope?

In order to make our solution approach a bit more tangible and down to earth, we are using [Domain Storytelling](https://domainstorytelling.org/).
All user stories can be found in the [`./doc/user-stories/`](./doc/user-stories) folder.
The following user stories are our main focus:

</details>


## 📑 Technical Documentation
> What was the rationale behind certain decisions we've made?

In order to be as transparent as possible, and provide a clean and reproducible line of thought, we captured all our technological decision with the help of [Architecture Decision Records](https://github.com/joelparkerhenderson/architecture_decision_record) which you can find in the [`/doc/architecture`](./doc/architecture) folder.
